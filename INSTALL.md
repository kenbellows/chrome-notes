# Installation

Installing is pretty easy.

1. Within Google Chrome, visit the Chrome Extensions page. Two equivalent methods:
    * Click the ![Chrome menu][] Chrome menu button, navigate into the "Tools" subfolder and click "Extensions".
    * Open a ![new tab][] new tab and go to the URL:
        chrome://extensions
2. Check the "Developer Mode" checkbox in the upper-right of the page if it is not already checked.
3. Click the "Load unpacked extension..." button.
4. Navigate through your file system to the location where you checked out the project. Select the "chrome-notes" 
   folder (assuming you haven't renamed it; if so, you know what to select).
   
That's it! You should see a little ![CN Icon][] pencil icon pop up next to the ![Chrome menu][] Chrome menu button. Click it and give it a try!

NOTE: At this point, deleting notes IS NOT WORKING, so you'll have to uninstall the extension when you're done playing around with 
it to get your regular page back.
