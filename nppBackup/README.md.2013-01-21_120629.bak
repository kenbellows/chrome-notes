![My face in pixels][icon] chrome-notes
===============================================

Chrome Notes (working title) is an extension written for the Google Chrome web browser.

I have found, while reading an article or tutorial, that I would like to add a note for myself,
such as a link to a related resource, a reflection on or reaction to the text, etc. I tried
searching for an existing "sticky-note" type extension, and found a few, but none had everything
I wanted, and ultimately I think I build a better one.

Here are a few I did find:

### [Simple Notes]


### [Self-stick Notes] 
This one is a very basic version of the sort of thing I plan to do with this extension.  
##### Problems:
* You can't edit a note once it is placed.
* Notes are not resizeable.
* Notes are opaque and block large sections of the page.

### [Sticky Notes]
This one is like several I found that allow adding notes to a page via a popup but do not allow placing notes around the page.

### [Web Page Sticky Notes]
Honestly, this extension is the best one I've found already out there.
##### Features:
* Places notes and retrieving them on page reload.
* Notes can be resized and recolored.
* Allows exporting and importing of notes.
* Notes can be "global", meaning they appear on every page.
* Definitely aesthetically pleasing, while remaining simple enough to not provide distraction.

##### Problems:
* Does not allow syncing with the cloud, because the creator decided it was not worth the limited storage compared to Local Storage.
* Still opaque, though being able to resize the note makes it easier to avoid hiding text.
