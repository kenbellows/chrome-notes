![My face in pixels][icon] chrome-notes
===============================================

Chrome Notes (working title) is an extension written for the Google Chrome web browser.

I have found, while reading an article or tutorial, that I would like to add a note for myself,
such as a link to a related resource, a reflection on or reaction to the text, etc. I tried
searching for an existing "sticky-note" type extension, and found a few, but none had everything
I wanted, and ultimately I think I build a better one.

Here are a few I did find:

[Simple Notes]

[Self-stick Notes]
